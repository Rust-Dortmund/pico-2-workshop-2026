# Bluetooth over Ethernet

This example extends the WiFi example with Bluetooth capabilities, allowing you to also read the current LED color and change it over BLE.

> [!NOTE]
> Like the WiFi example, running this example requires a nightly Rust toolchain (for picoserve's ITAIT routing).

> `trouble-host` 0.7 is pulled from crates.io. Published `cyw43` 0.7.0 still depends on `bt-hci` 0.8, which is incompatible with `trouble-host` 0.7 (`bt-hci` 0.9). This crate therefore patches the Embassy stack from a pinned [git revision](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/commit/c708723686ce80f83c80b059f04446c732db7272) (see `[patch.crates-io]` in `Cargo.toml`). That pulls in `cyw43` with `bt-hci` 0.9 and requires a few API updates in `main.rs` (dual DMA channels, `Cyw43439` chip type on `Runner`) — see the comments there.
